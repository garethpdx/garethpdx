👋 I'm Gareth. I enjoy shipping products and features that make easy things easy and hard things possible.

🧰 Most of my work is full-stack, and tools of choice are Vue.js, RESTful APIs, Django and Python, usually with a MySQL or MSSQL backend. I'm currently a Technical Director (basically SWE w/ a report) on the ActionKit team at Bonterra. 

🔎 Lately I've been interested in algorithm & data structure puzzles, tribal knowledge around distributed systems, and static site generators.
