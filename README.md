👋 I'm Gareth. I enjoy shipping products and features that make easy things easy and hard things possible.

🧰 Most of my work is full-stack, and tools of choice are Vue.js, RESTful APIs, Django and Python, usually with a MySQL or MSSQL backend. Most recently I was a Sr. Technical Director on the ActionKit team at NGP VAN.
